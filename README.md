# SQL_Data_Cleaning_Project
In this project, I worked with a layoff dataset to perform data cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, handling null or blank values, eliminating irrelevant rows and columns, and standardizing the data. This project helped me deepen my understanding of SQL and apply it to a real-world, industry-level dataset.
